# GeekyBudget
Budgeting app made by Logan Demaray and Jonah Veit

To use, download .NET from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/sdk-9.0.101-macos-arm64-installer

Run 'dotnet build'

Then run 'dotnet dev-certs https --trust' for the first time.

Finally, run 'dotnet run --launch-profile https'.

That will start the API and you can see it working by looking up 'https://localhost:7003/api/http'.
